# Tribute to Rattlesnake

## 👑🐊🧙‍♂️

I'm a fan of the King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard. When I saw the video 'Rattlesnake' I got hook because the effects in the video but mostly, because the mountains.

I was sure I had seen this effect in somewhere, maybe in TV or in a movie, so after a research I got the algorithm name: **Perlin Noise**.

I could build this stuff thanks to [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKB1hWWedMk) channel. Please support it on YouTube!

## Built with:
- React
- ThreeJS
- [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber)
- The rattlesnake video and song.

## Can I use it?
Yes, sure 🧙‍♂️ I'll be really thankful if you mention me or this repo in your project.
